					<h3>Current Work: Orbital Eccentricities of Small Planets around Small Stars</h3>
					<h4>The Orbital Eccentricities of the Kepler M dwarf Planets: A Population-Level View of Planet Dynamics around Small Stars</h4>
					<p> Abstract: Exoplanet orbital eccentricities encode key information about planetary system formation and evolution. For M dwarf planets in particular, the proximity of the habitable zone to the host star makes eccentricity additionally important for understanding habitability. However, constraints on orbital eccentricity typically require long and resource-intensive radial velocity campaigns. We summarize an investigation to extract eccentricity measurements of 143 planets orbiting early- to mid-M dwarfs across 81 systems, employing only their light curves from Kepler and host star density constraints from spectroscopy and Gaia. The "photoeccentric effect," described in exoplanet literature, enables the measurement of orbital eccentricity from a careful combination of transit duration and Kepler's 3rd law: both are linked to the stellar density. A disagreement between the stellar density inferred from the measured transit duration, and the density from Kepler's 3rd law, points to a non-zero orbital eccentricity. Employing our machinery in a standardized way on each of the 143 exoplanets, we derive an eccentricity posterior distribution for each. Through a hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we apply these individual posteriors to derive a population-level eccentricity distribution for planets around early- to mid-M dwarfs. Comparisons between the eccentricity distribution for singly- and multiply-transiting systems, as well as the distribution between M dwarfs and FGK dwarfs, help illuminate the dynamical states of M dwarf planets at a population level.</p>

					<h4><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab9224">Upper Limits on Planet Occurrence around Ultracool Dwarfs with K2</a> </h4>
					<p> Abstract: The occurrence of planets orbiting ultracool dwarfs is poorly constrained. We present results from a guest observer program on NASA's K2 spacecraft to search for transiting planets orbiting a sample of 827 ultracool dwarfs. Having found no transiting planets in our sample, we determined an upper limit on the occurrence of planets. We simulated planets orbiting our sample for a range of orbital periods and sizes. For the simulated planets that transit their host, we injected the transit light curve into the real K2 light curves, then attempted to recover the injected planets. For a given occurrence rate, we calculated the probability of seeing no planets, and use the results to place an upper limit on planet occurrence as a function of planet radius and orbital period. We find that short-period, mini-Neptune- and Jupiter-sized planets are rare around ultracool dwarfs, consistent with results for early- and mid-type M dwarf stars. We constrain the occurrence rate η for planets between 0.5 and 10 R⊕ with orbital periods between 1 and 26.3 days.</p>
